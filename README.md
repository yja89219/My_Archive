# My_Archive
My archive contains some codes I feel interesting. They might be something I wrote or something from other people. 
<ol>
  <li>Code Generator:</li>
  <p>It is the first code I wrote. It is simply just a function that will reverse the user's input.</p>
  <li>HTML+CSS+JavaScript:</li>
  <p>A series of practice: star grading, checking entering format in a form, photo carousel... etc.</p>
</ol>
